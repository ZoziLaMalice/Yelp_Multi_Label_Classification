# Yelp_Multi_Label_Classification

# Competition Description

Does your favorite Ethiopian restaurant take reservations? Will a first date at that authentic looking bistro break your wallet? Is the diner down the street a good call for breakfast? Restaurant labels help Yelp users quickly answer questions like these, narrowing down their results to only restaurants that fit their nuanced needs.</br>

In this competition, Yelp is challenging Kagglers to build a model that automatically tags restaurants with multiple labels using a dataset of user-submitted photos. Currently, restaurant labels are manually selected by Yelp users when they submit a review. Selecting the labels is optional, leaving some restaurants un- or only partially-categorized. </br>

In an age of food selfies and photo-centric social storytelling, it may be no surprise to hear that Yelp's users upload an enormous amount of photos every day alongside their written reviews. Can you turn their pictures into (less than a thousand) words?</br>
